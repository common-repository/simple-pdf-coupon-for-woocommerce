WooCommerce Simple PDF Coupon module to create PDF coupons

Define a new product, using the "Simple PDF Coupon"-Type. 
Adjust coupon sujet, positions and font-sizes in "WooCommerce > Simple PDF Coupons".

Customers can define their own coupon value on product detail page by using a range-slider.
Furthermore dustomers can add a personal greeting to the coupon.

When ordering this product, a WooCommerce-coupon is created automatically and the customer receives a PDF-document with all this ordered coupons.

As a web agency (LEMONTEC), we often need this solution, which we want to share with others.
